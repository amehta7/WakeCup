# WakeCup

WakeCup is a boutique coffee company based in Seattle and specializes in unique coffee blends from hand-picked coffee plantations from around the world. WakeCup offers a range of coffee powders, brewing equipment and has a handful of cafeterias where one can enjoy coffee over great conversation and ambience. The company, which started in 2006 has had a terrible website and wants to start afresh to gain traction in the venture capital market as they’re keen on expanding their presence and crossing borders to other countries in Americas and Europe and perhaps later, the world. 

“WakeCup isn’t just a call to rise and win, it is our mission to tap into the finest plantations and estates for the greatest coffee that our planet produces. Whether it’s a steaming mug of straight up cappuccino, a tumbler of flavoursome Indian filter kaapi, or a tall glass of vanilla matcha latte - we’ve got the blend that puts the zing in your step and the life in your day!
 
WakeCup with us!”
